      <p class="Volunteer">I stayed in Romania for two months with the Special Needs Support project. It’s hard to put my experience into words, but to start it was incredible, enlightening and life changing. The people I met, the staff and children I worked with - I’ll truly never forget them. Romania is a beautiful country and fairly undiscovered by hordes of tourists so it’s a lot of fun to travel around.
