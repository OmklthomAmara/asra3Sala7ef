        <p>We work hard to ensure that our volunteering opportunities are truly affordable. We are 100%
          transparent with our fees – something our volunteers really appreciate. Our structured programs create the
          perfect platform for you to see the world, meet like-minded people and engage in meaningful volunteering work.
          We have teams throughout our local destinations who will support you 24/7.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, every program is
          regularly risk-assessed by our management team to ensure our set up is safe and that our volunteers are making
          a
          positive impact in the community.</p>



        There is also a great social element to our opportunities. Even if you’re travelling alone, you’re going to meet
        heaps of people along the way and make friends for life. Plus you’ll have plenty of opportunity to travel the
        country with your newfound travel buddies – it’s all part of the experience!
